Hi Folks ðŸ‘‹,

I love building applications centered around deep learning and data science. I have a passion for building state of the art NLP models for translation, classification, and digging into unique problems. You can check out my website on [jessemoore.ca](jessemoore.ca) which can get a bit behind, but I try to keep up to date on what I'm working on.

If you're working on (or thinking about looking into) applied deep learning, I'd be excited to help out!
