Hi Folks ðŸ‘‹,

I love building applications centered around deep learning and data science. I have a passion for building state-of-the-art NLP models for translation, classification, and digging into unique problems. You can check out my website on jessemoore.ca to learn a bit more about how I think.

If you're working on (or thinking about looking into) applied deep learning and machine learning, I'd be excited to help out!
